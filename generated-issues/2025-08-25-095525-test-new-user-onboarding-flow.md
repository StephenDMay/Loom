# FEATURE: Test New User Onboarding Flow

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature adds automated testing to the new user onboarding flow. This ensures a smooth and reliable experience for new users, reduces manual testing effort, and helps prevent regressions as the onboarding process evolves. This feature will focus on end-to-end testing, covering key steps like account creation, email verification, profile completion, and initial tutorial interaction.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS

*   **Relevant Components:**
    *   `frontend/components/OnboardingFlow.js` (React component for the onboarding flow)
    *   `backend/api/users.py` (API endpoints for user creation and management)
    *   `backend/services/email.py` (Email sending service for verification)
    *   `database/models.py` (User data model)
*   **Integration Points:**
    *   The tests will interact with the frontend through a testing framework like Playwright or Cypress.
    *   The tests will interact with the backend API to create test users and verify data.
    *   The tests will need access to the email service (or a mock) to verify email verification functionality.
*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   Adding tests will require modifying the CI/CD pipeline to run the tests automatically.
    *   The tests will need to be designed to avoid interfering with the production database (e.g., using a separate test database).
*   **Technical Debt:**
    *   The existing codebase may lack proper test hooks or IDs, requiring minor modifications to make it more testable.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH

*   **User Workflows:**
    1.  User navigates to the signup page.
    2.  User enters email, username, and password.
    3.  User receives a verification email.
    4.  User clicks the verification link.
    5.  User is redirected to the profile completion page.
    6.  User completes their profile information.
    7.  User is guided through an initial tutorial.
*   **Industry Best Practices:**
    *   End-to-end testing is crucial for onboarding flows to ensure all components work together correctly.
    *   Use a dedicated testing environment to avoid impacting production data.
    *   Implement robust test data management to create and clean up test users.
    *   Use clear and descriptive test names to easily identify failures.
*   **Performance, UX, and Scalability Requirements:**
    *   The tests should run quickly and efficiently to avoid slowing down the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   The tests should be reliable and avoid false positives.
    *   The tests should be scalable to handle increasing user volume.
*   **Competitive Solutions:**
    *   Many SaaS platforms use end-to-end testing frameworks like Cypress or Playwright to test their onboarding flows.
    *   Some platforms also use visual regression testing to detect UI changes.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

*   **Recommended Implementation Strategy:**
    *   Use Playwright for end-to-end testing due to its cross-browser support, auto-waiting capabilities, and ease of use.
    *   Create a separate test database to avoid impacting production data.
    *   Use environment variables to configure the test environment.
    *   Implement a test data management strategy to create and clean up test users.
    *   Mock the email service to avoid sending real emails during testing.
*   **Alternative Approaches:**
    *   Cypress could be used instead of Playwright, but it only supports JavaScript.
    *   Unit tests could be written for individual components of the onboarding flow, but they would not provide the same level of confidence as end-to-end tests.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION

### Database Changes

*   Create a new database for testing (e.g., `test_database`).
*   Update the database connection settings in the test environment to use the test database.
*   Implement database migrations to ensure the test database schema is up-to-date.

### API Design

*   No new API endpoints are required.
*   Consider adding a `/test/users/cleanup` endpoint to delete all test users for cleanup purposes. This endpoint should be protected and only accessible in the test environment.

### Frontend Components

*   Add `data-testid` attributes to key elements in the onboarding flow to make them easily targetable by Playwright.
    *   Example: `<input type="email" data-testid="email-input" />`
*   Ensure that the frontend handles different environments correctly (e.g., using a different API endpoint in the test environment).

### Backend Services

*   Implement a mock email service for testing. This service should capture the emails that would be sent and allow the tests to verify their content.
*   Add logic to the user creation endpoint to allow creating users with a pre-verified email address for testing purposes.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Technical Risks

*   **Risk 1:** Playwright may have compatibility issues with certain browsers or operating systems. - **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test the tests on different platforms.
*   **Risk 2:** The tests may be flaky due to timing issues or network latency. - **Mitigation:** Implement retry mechanisms and use Playwright's auto-waiting capabilities.
*   **Risk 3:** Maintaining the tests as the onboarding flow evolves may be time-consuming. - **Mitigation:** Write clear and maintainable tests and use a modular test structure.

### Business Risks

*   **Risk 1:** The tests may not catch all bugs in the onboarding flow. - **Mitigation:** Supplement the end-to-end tests with other types of testing, such as unit tests and manual testing.
*   **Risk 2:** The tests may slow down the CI/CD pipeline, delaying deployments. - **Mitigation:** Optimize the tests for performance and run them in parallel.
