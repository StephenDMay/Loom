# FEATURE: User Authentication with JWT Tokens

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature adds secure user authentication to the system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).  This is crucial for protecting user data and controlling access to the system's resources, enabling a secure and reliable development environment.  It will integrate with existing user management systems and allow developers to securely access and manage their projects.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The current system lacks a robust authentication mechanism.  Integration will require adding JWT generation and verification capabilities.  Existing APIs will need modification to include authentication headers.  The database schema will need to be updated to store user credentials securely (hashed passwords).  We'll need to analyze existing user management components (if any) to determine integration points.  We'll also need to assess how authentication interacts with the AI model orchestration layer to ensure secure access to models and data.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
Developers need a secure and seamless authentication experience.  Industry best practices dictate using JWT for its stateless nature and ease of integration.  User workflows will involve registration, login, and potentially different access levels based on roles.  Competitive solutions typically offer secure authentication through various methods (OAuth, JWT, etc.).  Scalability is crucial; the authentication system must handle a large number of concurrent users.  We need to consider single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for future expansion.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
We will implement JWT authentication using a standard library like `PyJWT` in Python.  A new API endpoint will handle user registration and login, generating JWTs upon successful authentication.  Existing APIs will be modified to verify JWTs in the authorization header.  The database will store user credentials securely using a robust hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).  We'll explore using a dedicated authentication service (e.g., Auth0) for enhanced security and scalability in the future.  Alternative approaches include using OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
- Add a `users` table with columns: `user_id` (INT, primary key), `username` (VARCHAR, unique), `password_hash` (VARCHAR), `role` (VARCHAR).
- Add appropriate indexes for efficient querying.

### API Design
- `/register`: POST endpoint to register new users.  Requires username and password.
- `/login`: POST endpoint to authenticate existing users.  Returns a JWT upon successful authentication.
- All existing APIs will be modified to require a JWT in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`).

### Frontend Components
- Implement login and registration forms.
- Securely store and manage the JWT in local storage (using appropriate security measures).
- Add authentication checks to protect routes and components.

### Backend Services
- Implement JWT generation and verification logic using `PyJWT`.
- Implement password hashing using bcrypt.
- Implement user registration and login logic.
- Integrate with existing user management (if any).
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC).


## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1**: Difficulty integrating with existing systems - **Mitigation**: Thorough code review and incremental integration.
- **Risk 2**: Security vulnerabilities in JWT implementation - **Mitigation**: Use established libraries and security best practices.  Regular security audits.
- **Risk 3**: Performance bottlenecks during authentication - **Mitigation**: Optimize database queries and caching mechanisms.

### Business Risks
- **Risk 1**: Poor user experience due to complex authentication flow - **Mitigation**: Design a user-friendly interface and provide clear error messages.
- **Risk 2**: Security breach leading to data loss - **Mitigation**: Implement robust security measures, including input validation, secure storage of credentials, and regular security audits.
