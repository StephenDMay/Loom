# FEATURE: User Login

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature enables users to securely log in to the system using a username/email and password combination. Successful login grants access to personalized features and data, while failed attempts are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages. This is a foundational feature for any user-centric application.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
*   **Existing Components:** Review existing user management components (if any), authentication middleware, and session management.
*   **Data Models:** Analyze the `User` data model to understand existing fields (username/email, password hash, salt, etc.).
*   **APIs:** Check for existing authentication-related APIs (e.g., registration, password reset).
*   **Integration Points:** The login feature will integrate with the user database, authentication middleware, and potentially session management services.
*   **Impact:** This feature will impact the authentication flow, session management, and potentially user roles and permissions.
*   **Technical Debt:** Assess the current password hashing algorithm and consider upgrading to a more secure option if necessary (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
*   **User Workflows:** Users expect a simple and intuitive login process. Common workflows include:
    *   Entering username/email and password.
    *   Handling incorrect credentials (invalid username/password).
    *   "Remember me" functionality (optional).
    *   Password reset flow (handled in a separate feature).
*   **Industry Best Practices:**
    *   Secure password hashing with salt.
    *   Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Input validation to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Secure session management (e.g., using HTTP-only cookies).
    *   Two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security (handled in a separate feature).
*   **Performance Requirements:** Login should be fast and responsive.
*   **UX Requirements:** Clear error messages, intuitive form design, and accessibility considerations.
*   **Competitive Solutions:** Analyze how other platforms handle user login (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub).

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
*   **Recommended Implementation:**
    1.  Create a new API endpoint for login (`/api/login`).
    2.  Implement a login form on the frontend.
    3.  On form submission, send the username/email and password to the `/api/login` endpoint.
    4.  In the backend, retrieve the user from the database based on the username/email.
    5.  Verify the password using a secure password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
    6.  If the password is correct, create a session for the user.
    7.  Return a success response to the frontend, potentially including a user token.
    8.  On the frontend, store the user token (e.g., in local storage or a cookie).
    9.  Use the user token to authenticate subsequent requests.
*   **Alternative Approaches:**
    *   Using a third-party authentication provider (e.g., Auth0, Firebase Authentication). This can simplify the implementation but introduces a dependency on an external service.
    *   Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. This allows for stateless authentication but requires careful management of JWT signing keys.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
*   No schema changes are required if the `User` model already contains fields for username/email, password hash, and salt.  If not, add these fields.
*   Consider adding a `last_login` field to the `User` model to track user activity.

### API Design
*   **New Endpoint:** `POST /api/login`
    *   **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
          "username": "string", // or "email": "string"
          "password": "string"
        }
        ```
    *   **Response (Success):**
        ```json
        {
          "success": true,
          "message": "Login successful",
          "token": "string" // User token (e.g., JWT)
        }
        ```
    *   **Response (Failure):**
        ```json
        {
          "success": false,
          "message": "Invalid username or password"
        }
        ```
*   **Authentication Middleware:** Implement middleware to authenticate requests based on the user token.

### Frontend Components
*   **Login Form:**
    *   Fields for username/email and password.
    *   Error message display for invalid credentials.
    *   "Remember me" checkbox (optional).
    *   Link to password reset page (handled in a separate feature).
*   **State Management:** Store the user token in the application state.
*   **User Interactions:** Handle form submission, display error messages, and redirect to the appropriate page after successful login.

### Backend Services
*   **Authentication Service:**
    *   Handles user authentication logic (retrieving user from the database, verifying password, creating session).
    *   Implements password hashing and salting.
    *   Implements rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Session Management Service:**
    *   Creates and manages user sessions.
    *   Stores session data (e.g., user ID, roles, permissions).

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
*   **Risk 1:** Insecure password hashing algorithm. - **Mitigation:** Upgrade to a more secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
*   **Risk 2:** Vulnerability to brute-force attacks. - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting.
*   **Risk 3:** Vulnerability to injection attacks. - **Mitigation:** Implement input validation.
*   **Risk 4:** Session hijacking. - **Mitigation:** Use secure session management (e.g., HTTP-only cookies, session invalidation on logout).

### Business Risks
*   **Risk 1:** Poor user experience due to a complicated login process. - **Mitigation:** Design a simple and intuitive login form.
*   **Risk 2:** Security breaches due to vulnerabilities in the login implementation. - **Mitigation:** Follow security best practices and conduct thorough testing.
