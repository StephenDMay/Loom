# FEATURE: Create a Test for Feature Research Agent

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This document outlines the plan to create a comprehensive unit test suite for the `FeatureResearchAgent`. This will ensure the agent's reliability, prevent regressions, and validate its functionality, including template loading, context discovery, and error handling.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS
The target for testing is `agents/feature_research_agent/agent.py`. The test will be created at `tests/agents/test_feature_research_agent.py`. The test will need to mock `core.llm_manager.LLMManager` and `core.context_manager.ContextManager` as they are dependencies of `FeatureResearchAgent`. The test will also need to mock file system interactions (`builtins.open`) to test template loading without actual file I/O.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH
Unit testing is a standard practice in software development to ensure code quality. The tests should follow the existing testing patterns in the `tests/` directory, likely using Python's `unittest` framework and `unittest.mock`.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH
Use Python's `unittest` module to create a test class `TestFeatureResearchAgent`. Use `unittest.mock` to create mock objects for dependencies (`LLMManager`, `ContextManager`). Write individual test methods for each unit of functionality:
- `test_initialization`: Verify the agent is created with the correct dependencies.
- `test_load_template`: Test that the template is read correctly from the file system (using a mock).
- `test_discover_available_context`: Test the agent's ability to get context from the `ContextManager`.
- `test_render_template`: Test the template rendering logic.
- `test_execute_success`: Test the successful execution of the agent.
- `test_execute_error`: Test the agent's error handling when a template is not found.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION
### Database Changes
None.

### API Design
None.

### Frontend Components
None.

### Backend Services
Create the test file `tests/agents/test_feature_research_agent.py`.

## RISK ASSESSMENT
### Technical Risks
- The tests might become tightly coupled to the implementation details of the agent. - Mitigation: Focus on testing the public interface of the agent.

### Business Risks
- None.

## PROJECT DETAILS
**Estimated Effort**: <1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Priority**: High
**Category**: technical-debt

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Specific files to create/modify: `tests/agents/test_feature_research_agent.py`
- Key classes/functions to implement: `TestFeatureResearchAgent` with the test methods listed above.
- Exact CLI command structure: `python3 -m unittest tests/agents/test_feature_research_agent.py`
- Clear acceptance criteria for "done"

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES
What is explicitly IN scope for this feature?
- Unit testing the `FeatureResearchAgent`.
What is explicitly OUT of scope and should be separate features?
- Integration testing with a real LLM or `ContextManager`.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] The test suite for `FeatureResearchAgent` is created.
- [ ] All tests pass when run.
- [ ] The tests cover the key functionalities of the agent.
