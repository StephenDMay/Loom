# FEATURE: User Dashboard

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This feature introduces a personalized user dashboard that provides a centralized view of key information, recent activity, and customizable widgets. It enhances user engagement, provides quick access to relevant data, and improves overall user experience.

## CODEBASE ANALYSIS

*   **Existing Components:** Review existing user profile components, authentication modules, and data retrieval services.
*   **Integration Points:** The dashboard will need to integrate with various backend services to fetch user-specific data (e.g., projects, tasks, notifications). It will also need to integrate with the existing UI framework for consistent styling and navigation.
*   **Impact:** Minimal impact on core authentication and authorization. Moderate impact on data retrieval services, requiring new queries and data aggregation logic.
*   **Technical Debt:** Evaluate the existing user profile page for potential refactoring opportunities to share components and reduce code duplication.

## DOMAIN RESEARCH

*   **User Workflows:** Users currently navigate through multiple pages to access different pieces of information. The dashboard aims to consolidate this information into a single, easily accessible view.
*   **Industry Patterns:** Common dashboard patterns include personalized widgets, activity feeds, quick access links, and customizable layouts.
*   **Competitive Analysis:** Analyze dashboards in similar developer tools (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Jira) to identify best practices and potential differentiators.
*   **Performance, UX, and Scalability:** The dashboard should load quickly, provide a clear and intuitive user interface, and scale to accommodate a growing number of users and data sources.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

The recommended approach is to use a modular design with customizable widgets. The frontend will fetch data from various backend services and display it in a visually appealing manner.

**Alternatives:**

*   **Server-Side Rendering:** Consider server-side rendering for improved initial load time and SEO.
*   **Pre-built Dashboard Libraries:** Evaluate using pre-built dashboard libraries (e.g., React-Grid-Layout) to accelerate development and provide advanced customization options.

## IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION

### Database Changes

*   **User Preferences Table:**
    *   `user_id` (INT, FK to users table)
    *   `widget_layout` (JSON, stores the layout and configuration of widgets)
    *   `theme` (VARCHAR, stores the user's preferred theme)

### API Design

*   **GET /api/dashboard:** Returns the user's dashboard data, including widget configurations and data for each widget.
*   **PUT /api/dashboard/widget/{widget_id}:** Updates the configuration of a specific widget.
*   **PUT /api/dashboard/layout:** Updates the user's dashboard layout.

### Frontend Components

*   **Dashboard Component:** The main component that renders the dashboard layout and widgets.
*   **Widget Container:** A reusable component that wraps each widget and provides common functionality (e.g., resizing, dragging, configuration).
*   **Widget Components:** Individual components for each widget (e.g., "Recent Activity," "Project Overview," "Task List").
*   **Configuration Modal:** A modal for configuring widget settings.

### Backend Services

*   **Dashboard Service:** Responsible for fetching user-specific data and assembling the dashboard response.
*   **Widget Services:** Individual services for each widget that fetch data from relevant data sources (e.g., project service, task service, notification service).

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Technical Risks

*   **Complexity:** Implementing a flexible and customizable dashboard can be complex, requiring careful design and testing. - **Mitigation:** Break down the feature into smaller, manageable components and use a modular design.
*   **Performance:** Fetching data from multiple sources can impact performance. - **Mitigation:** Implement caching, optimize database queries, and use asynchronous data loading.

### Business Risks

*   **User Experience:** A poorly designed dashboard can be confusing and frustrating for users. - **Mitigation:** Conduct user testing and iterate on the design based on feedback.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Slow loading times can negatively impact user engagement. - **Mitigation:** Continuously monitor performance and optimize the dashboard as needed.

## PROJECT DETAILS

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies**: User authentication and authorization modules, existing data retrieval services.
**Priority**: High
**Category**: Feature

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

*   **Files to Create/Modify:**
    *   `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js`
    *   `frontend/src/components/WidgetContainer.js`
    *   `frontend/src/components/widgets/*.js`
    *   `backend/services/dashboard_service.py`
    *   `backend/api/dashboard_api.py`
    *   `database/migrations/create_user_preferences_table.sql`
*   **Key Classes/Functions:**
    *   `Dashboard` component: Renders the dashboard layout and manages widgets.
    *   `WidgetContainer` component: Provides common widget functionality.
    *   `DashboardService.get_dashboard_data()`: Fetches and assembles dashboard data.
    *   `DashboardApi.get_dashboard()`: API endpoint for retrieving the dashboard.
*   **CLI Command Structure:** N/A
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** See below.

## SCOPE BOUNDARIES

**IN Scope:**

*   Basic dashboard layout with customizable widgets.
*   "Recent Activity," "Project Overview," and "Task List" widgets.
*   User preferences for widget layout and theme.

**OUT of Scope:**

*   Advanced widget customization options (e.g., custom data sources).
*   Real-time data updates (consider a separate feature for this).
*   Integration with third-party services (consider separate features for each integration).

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

*   [x] User can access the dashboard after logging in.
*   [x] The dashboard displays relevant information based on the user's activity and projects.
*   [x] User can customize the dashboard layout by adding, removing, and rearranging widgets.
*   [x] User can configure widget settings (e.g., number of items to display).
*   [x] The dashboard loads quickly and provides a responsive user interface.
*   [x] The dashboard respects user roles and permissions.
