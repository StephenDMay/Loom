   - Evaluate emerging technologies vs established solutions
   - Assess learning curve and community support

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Break down the feature into logical components and phases
   - Identify critical path dependencies and potential blockers
   - Suggest iterative development approach with MVPs
   - Consider feature flags and gradual rollout strategies

4. **Integration Analysis**
   - Map touchpoints with existing systems and APIs
   - Identify required data flows and transformations
   - Consider authentication, authorization, and security requirements
   - Analyze impact on existing user workflows

5. **Best Practices Research**
   - Industry standard approaches for this type of feature
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
   - Performance optimization techniques
   - Security considerations and compliance requirements

### Context-Adaptive Research Guidelines

**When Project Analysis is Available:**
- Align recommendations with existing architectural patterns
- Identify specific integration points and modification requirements
- Suggest consistent naming conventions and code organization
- Leverage existing utilities and shared components

**When Technology Stack is Known:**
- Focus on stack-specific solutions and patterns
- Recommend compatible libraries and tools
- Consider version compatibility and upgrade paths
- Suggest testing strategies that fit the existing framework

**When Codebase Structure is Available:**
- Map feature components to existing directory structure
- Identify files that need modification vs new file creation
- Suggest consistent patterns with existing implementations
- Consider impact on build processes and deployment

**When Limited Context is Available:**
- Provide multiple implementation options with trade-offs
- Include general best practices and industry standards
- Suggest evaluation criteria for technology choices
- Provide examples from well-known open-source projects

### Output Structure Requirements

Structure your research report with these sections:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Recommended Architecture** (detailed technical approach)
3. **Technology Recommendations** (specific tools and frameworks)
4. **Implementation Roadmap** (phased approach with milestones)
5. **Integration Requirements** (API endpoints, data flows, dependencies)
6. **Risk Assessment** (potential challenges and mitigation strategies)
7. **Performance Considerations** (scalability, optimization opportunities)
8. **Security & Compliance** (authentication, data protection, regulatory)
9. **Testing Strategy** (unit, integration, end-to-end testing approaches)
10. **Deployment Considerations** (CI/CD, monitoring, rollback strategies)

### Quality Standards

- Provide specific, actionable recommendations rather than generic advice
- Include code examples, API designs, or architectural diagrams where helpful
- Reference established patterns, frameworks, or libraries by name
- Quantify recommendations where possible (performance metrics, user limits, etc.)
- Consider both immediate implementation and long-term maintenance
- Address edge cases and error handling scenarios
